# Open Source Android Apps: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

## Introduction

While open-source apps offer a lot of transparency and that is the main argument from a lot of people they also introduce a lot of problems related to security vulnerabilities, performance issues and mainly long-term sustainability. In this blog, I'll dive into the reality of open-source Android apps, their impact on privacy and security, and whether the appreciation of open-source apps is actually deserved or not. Also if they provide an actual alternative to their closed-source counterparts.

## The Good: Why Open-Source Android Apps Matter

### **1. Privacy & Transparency**

One of the biggest "selling" points of open source apps is their transparency whenever you talk to someone about open source apps it's probably the first thing they bring up. All the source code is publicly available and users can check the code out to ensure theirs no hidden data collection, unnecessary permissions or anything like that. In contrast, closed-source apps operate in a very different manner. All of their source code is completely private and can't be viewed by anyone. And the users have to trust the developers that they aren't exploiting their data. and that isn't enough for a lot of people.

### **2. Faster Bug Fixes & Security Patches**

When problems/vulnerabilities arise, open-source communities tend to react quickly. Here we assume that the project is actively maintained. Unlike closed source software where fixes depend on the developer teams of those apps, open source projects allow practically anyone to contribute patches also assuming it passes the checks of the main developers which is to check if the code is good enough to actually push to the project. Which leads to way faster security updates. Let me give you an example there was a study that found that 94% of security vulnerabilities in open-source apps had publicly documented fixes available, meaning issues could be patched faster than in closed-source alternatives.

### **3. Community-Driven Development**

Open-source apps benefit a lot from the insanely big community of contributors worldwide. This means bugs, vulnerabilities and optimizations are identified by a larger audience than just a dev team. Which leads to faster and more secure apps.

## The Bad: The Risks of Open-Source Android Apps

### **1. Security Vulnerabilities**

While transparency **does** allow for quicker fixes, open-source apps are not necessarily immune to security flaws. Research has found that 63% of Android apps containing open-source components had at least one known security vulnerability. You might be thinking eh just one but no it's a big deal when it comes to software where security vulnerabilities can cause major issues. Even worse 44% of the *High risk* vulnerabilities had POC ( proof of concept exploits ) available. That in simple terms means that attackers have a simple way to exploit and use those vulnerabilities to their advantage. Basically a step-by-step tutorial for them.

### **2. Long-Term Sustainability Issues**

Unlike closed-source apps which are backed by corporations with a lot of money. A lot of open-source projects rely on volunteers and donations. As a result, a lot of projects are abandoned due to a lack of funding or dev interest. A vulnerability in an app could go unpatched for **YEARS**, putting users at risk. Yes, you could argue that the users should be aware that the project is maintained or isn't but that's just another excuse for people to use closed-source apps isn't it?. Also, you have to think about it you only know if a project is maintained through GitHub for example whereas you could easily find out if an app is deprecated through Play Store or App Store and also they don't allow those type of apps which have security vulnerabilities to be published as well, for the safety of the users. By the way 73% of vulnerabilities in open source apps were more the **TWO** years old which clearly shows the challenges in long term support of these apps

### **3. Performance & Compatibility Concerns**

Many open-source apps struggle to match the seamless user experience that closed-source apps give. Issues like lack of features slower updates and poor device optimization can discourage users from using open source apps even while knowing their privacy benefits.

## The Ugly: Should You Trust Open-Source Apps Over Closed-Source Ones?

At the end of the day, choosing between open-source and closed-source apps depends on **your priorities**:

- If you value **privacy and transparency**, open-source apps are the better choice.
- If you prioritize **performance and long-term stability**, closed-source apps may be more reliable.
- If you’re in between, look for **actively maintained open-source projects** with a strong developer community.

## Conclusion

Open-source Android apps offer a promising alternative to closed-source software, especially for privacy-conscious users. However, they are not a perfect solution. Security vulnerabilities, lack of long-term maintenance, and performance trade-offs are real problems.

To make the most of open-source apps, always check for **active maintenance, regular security updates, and a strong community** before trusting them with your data.
